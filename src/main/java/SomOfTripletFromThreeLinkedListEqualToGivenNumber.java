/**
 * Given three linked lists, say a, b and c, find one node from each list such that the sum of the values of the nodes is equal to a given number.
 For example, if the three linked lists are 12->6->29, 23->5->8 and 90->20->59, and the given number is 101, the output should be tripel “6 5 90″.

 In the following solutions, size of all three linked lists is assumed same for simplicity of analysis. solutions work for linked lists of different sizes also.
